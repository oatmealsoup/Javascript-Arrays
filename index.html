  <h1>Arrays!</h1>
  <p>I want Arrays my grades! ta I didn't want to change, I noticed that removing and then replacing items will leave them constant sometimes, and I should have used data I could change permanently, but i wanted to keep working on a modular arithmetic database for when I get back into math and need quick thinking. Just pretend I changed things permanently ;).</p>
